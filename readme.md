## Hi. You can call me Reinaldy.

To be honest, I'm not really a programmer. I work on other stuff (on a different industry). 
So, if I ever answered your question, or suggested you something, 50% of it might be working, 50% else might be misleading.

But, mostly a full-stack web dev. 

You can reach me via email (see my profile info).

A little bit about me:
* A [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) guy
* Do [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for backend
* Likes [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because it's fun
