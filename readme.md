## Hi. You can call me Reinaldy.

To be honest, I never went to tech school. But, here I am working as a software engineer at some company anyway.
So, if I ever answered your question, or suggested you something, 50% of it might be working, 50% else might be misleading.

But, mostly a full-stack web dev. At least this is what I wanted to be. Reality is harsh, nowadays I became a full-stack IT department
who does software development, software operation, system administrator, devops, and network infrastructure. Please do not aspire to
have similar job experience like me.

You can reach me via email (see my profile info) or Matrix [@aldy505:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@aldy505:matrix.org).

A little bit about me:
* A [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) guy, but for frontend work I also do [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/).
* Most comfortable with [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for backend.
* Sometimes does [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) too for backend.
* Likes [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because it's fun
