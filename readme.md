## Hi. You can call me Reinaldy. 

To be honest, I never went to tech school. I just do it as a hobby. But, I work as a software engineer at some company anyway.
So, if I ever answered your question, or suggested you something, 50% of it might be working, 50% else might be misleading.

But, mostly a full-stack web dev. 

You can reach me via [Telegram](https://t.me/aldy505) or email (see my profile info).

Alright, a little bit about me:
* A [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) guy
* Do [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for backend
* Likes [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because it's fun
* Already gave up on [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). Don't @ me on that.
