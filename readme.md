## Hi, I'm Reinaldy.

Full disclosure: I don't have a formal tech education. My experience comes from diving into the deep endâ€”learning by building, breaking, and fixing things in a live environment.

Being a web developer has been a part of my life since I was a kid. You could say I've stuck with it, and I've really found my place in the full-stack world. There's so much to learn and explore, which shows that software engineering is a lot more than what you read in books.

Working in a small company with a small IT team means I do more than just full-stack development. I also handle infrastructure, DevOps, IT security, and even talk directly with customers. Honestly, it's a role I wouldn't recommend to most. It requires a high tolerance for chaos. But the immense upside is that you're forced to learn how everything is truly connected, leaving no hidden secrets.

If you want to talk, you can email me (see my profile) or find me on Matrix: [@aldy505:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@aldy505:matrix.org).

A glimpse into my stack:

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (and lately [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the parts of a website you see)
* [Go](https://golang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (my preferred languages for the hidden logic, with [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) when a project calls for them)
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) (for when I want to explore something completely different)
